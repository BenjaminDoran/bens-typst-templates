# Description
This is just me playing around with getting some simple and personal templates together. 

Feel free to use, But I'm offering no support.

# install to personal computer

```
cd ~/projects
git clone git@github.com:BenjaminDoran/bens-typst-templates.git
ln -s ~/projects/bens-typst-templates ~/Library/Caches/typst/packages/local
```
